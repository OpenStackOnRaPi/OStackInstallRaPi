# - We define "device" in networkd.netdev because we need to set VLANFiltering=true (impossible
# to be set in netplan). As a result, definining brmux is no longer needed in the netplan file
# (indeed, defining brmux there would result in incorrect network configuration - see the description
# in the netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml file).
# - This definition only ycreates the brmux device, but it remains inactive (Down). We set it up in the
# brmux.network file.
