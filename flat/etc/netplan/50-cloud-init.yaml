#-----------------------------------------#
# WiFi can be hepful during configurations when we will teporarily loose connectivity to
# RPis from the fixed (cable) network used by OpenStack). RPis (but not OpenStack) will
# then be accessible via WiFi
# WiFi should be configured as isolated subnetwork - distinct form the fixed (cable)
# network used to access OpenStack (provider external network/management network).
# E.g., on Linksys, you dedicate a separate bridge (e.g., br1) to WiFi with
# distinct IP address range for this subnetwork. You will also have to enable routing
# between WiFi subnetwork and the fixed subnetwork used to access OpenStack.

## wlan0 itf will receive IP address from your router DHCP (linksys or TOTOLink in our case).
#  adjust access point SSID and password according to your environment
#  wifis:
#    wlan0:
#      access-points:
#        someaccesspoint:
#          password: somepassword
#      dhcp4: true
#      optional: true
