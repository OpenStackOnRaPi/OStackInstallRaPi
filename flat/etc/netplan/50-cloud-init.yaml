#-----------------------------------------#
# WiFi can be hepful during configurations when we will teporarily loose connectivity to
# RPis from the fixed (cable) network used by OpenStack). RPis (but not OpenStack) will
# then be accessible via WiFi
# WiFi should be configured as isolated subnetwork - distinct form the fixed (cable)
# network used to access OpenStack (provider external network/management network).
# E.g., on Linksys, you dedicate a separate bridge (e.g., br1) to WiFi with
# distinct IP address range for this subnetwork. You will also have to enable routing
# between WiFi subnetwork and the fixed subnetwork used to access OpenStack.

## wlan0 itf will receive IP address from your router DHCP (linksys or TOTOLink in our case).
#  adjust access point SSID and password according to your environment
#  wifis:
#    wlan0:
#      access-points:
#        someaccesspoint:
#          password: somepassword

# In the following, only veth0 and veth1 are necessary. The rest is incorrect when using systemd-networkd.
# It has been left for educational/comparative purposes. However, if only flat network were to be used in
# our OpenStack then one could uncomment the below definitions and not use systemd-networkd files at all.
#
# EXPLANATION: We must use systemd-networkd for persistent network constructs because some settings we need
# to set VLANs for provider networks are not possible to declare in netplan (at least at the time of this
# writing). At the same time, the rule for using netplan and systemd-networkd simultaneously is that a
# definition of a given network related construct must not appear in both the netplan file and the networkd file.
#
# For example, uncommenting the bridge "brmux" with interfaces "veth0br" and "veth1br" will result in
# incorrect VLAN configuration for those interfaces (they will be completely ignored) - see also the
# files in the /etc/systemd/network/ directory. In contrast, the DHCP declaration for eth0, and the
# addressing/DNS and IP routing settings for veth0 are correct, because they supplement the
# definitions of eth0 and veth0 with new elements (addressing and routing) - these elements
# are not present in the definitions provided in the /etc/systemd/network/ directory.
#
# Note: if netplan allows to define tagged VLANS for bridge interfaces that using systemd-networkd files
# will not be necessary and all configurations we need will be possible to define in this file.
