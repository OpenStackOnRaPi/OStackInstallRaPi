# Definitions of tagged VLANs
# We use systemd files because tagged VLANs cannot currently be set in netplan (this may change someday)

[Match]
Name=eth0
#Type=ether

[Network]
Bridge=brmux

# VLAN for a flat provider external network extending across the physical network infrastructure.
# - this VLAN will be invisible at the OpenStack level - in brmux, it will be replaced with
# VLAN1 (untagged) and OpenStack will receive it as "flat"
# - in fact, it could be omitted at all and a standard untagged ethernet could be used, but we
# are introducing it for educational purposes to better highlight the VLAN provider networks.

VLAN=2

# VLANs for VLAN provider networks (implemented as tagged VLANs)
# for educational purposes - three VLANs are completely sufficient

VLAN=101-103
